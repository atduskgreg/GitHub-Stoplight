h1. GitHub Spotlight Project

h2. Spec

Connect the GitHub Spotlight to a microcontroller so it can be controlled by the GitHub continuous integration system.

h2. Proposal

I intend to use the "Black Widow Arduino":http://asynclabs.com/store?page=shop.product_details&flypage=flypage.tpl&product_id=23&category_id=11&keyword=wifi to control three relays to turn on and off each of the stoplight's lights. The Black Widow with comes with a built-in wifi antenna so I will be able to make it controllable via a web interface accessible via the local network.

The relays and arduino will fit inside the existing stoplight case.

The only possible necessary modification will be to drill a hole for the power supply cord.

h2. Budget

$75 Black Widow Arduino 
$36 3x Sparkfun Relay Control w/ PCB ($12 ea.)
$5 9V wall wart for Arduino
Total: $116
